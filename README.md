# 🛢️ Oil Pump (SolidWorks Project)

This project is a **mechanical design study** created with **SolidWorks**.  
The "Oil Pump" mechanism is modeled to simulate the structural and motion behavior of a oil pump system.  

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- Designed in **SolidWorks 2022** (compatible with newer versions).  
- Includes **part files (.SLDPRT)**, and **assembly file (.SLDASM)**.  
- Demonstrates the use of:
  - **Assemblies** with mates
  - **Material assignment**
